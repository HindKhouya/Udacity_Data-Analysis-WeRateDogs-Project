One possibility is that as the account has increased in popularity, the writer caught on to the popularity of the exceedingly high ratings, and began to use them increasingly often.  Another possibility is that the increasingly high ratings themselves have driven the growing popularity of this account."

The Pomeranian Dog, for instance, is the most highly-rated dog, However it is not one of the top 10 most retweeted and most-favorited dogs.  Another few all-around favorites are the kuvasz, the Great Pyrenees, and the Border terrier.  The Golden Retriever, despite being highly-rated, does not make the top 10 in either retweets or favorites, perhaps because the dog breed is so common.\n",

    "To conclude, a preliminary analysis shows that readers particularly enjoy certain dog stages; that the excessive dog ratings are popular, and have 'grown' as the popularity of the content has steadily increased; and that certain breeds of dogs are particularly beloved.  In most cases, the precise relationship between the variables is unclear - did higher dog ratings drive account popularity, did the writer catch on to higher ratings being popular with his followers?  Some of these questions might be answered with a more in-depth analysis of the temporal relationship between these variables."
